        <p>
          I have been in software development for more than one year now.
          <br />
          <br /> I started with Flutter, and made 3 Android Apps, 2 of which are
          being used by my client and his community. <br />
          <br />I have been working with web development for nearly one year. I
          have more than 14 web projects. So far, techs I have worked with
          include HTML5 (Semantic HTML), CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid), Javascript (ES6),
          Bootstrap 5, TailwindCSS, React, React Query, React Router DOM, React
          Bootstrap, Material Tailwind, Material UI, Node, Express, and MongoDB.
          I have also worked with Firebase Authentication, Firebase Cloud
          Firestore, Firebase Admin SDK (Node), HTTP-only JWT Authorization
          (Node), and MongoDB.

          The list of my favorite technologies includes— Data Structures and

          WordPress, Java, JavaFX, Kotlin, (Native) Android, Python, Dart,
          Flutter (Full Stack), C, C++, Firebase, MongoDB and MySQL. The list of

          Besides computer technologies, I love Mathematics and Physics.
          <br /> <br />
          My prime focus is to be a Full Stack Web Developer— but with a decent
          grasp in Mobile and Desktop App Development.
